                    I’ve always been someone who embraces change, enjoys challenges, and actively seeks opportunities to
                    grow — and it’s something I truly practice, not just something I say.
                </p>

            <p>
                Back in high school, my strongest subjects were mathematics, chemistry, history, and languages. Yet when
                it came time for university, I chose a different path and studied design simply because I wanted to
                explore a new creative direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating, I worked for several years as a graphic and UI designer. Being part of software teams
                exposed me to the engineering side of product development, and I gradually became fascinated by how
                software is built. That curiosity pushed me to learn programming on my own, and eventually I moved to
                Ireland to study computer science. There, I focused on software development while also building a solid
                foundation in data science and cloud computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing my studies in Ireland, I relocated to Finland with my family. During this transition, I
                joined a Full Stack Development training program to further strengthen my hands-on coding skills and
                demonstrate my technical capabilities through diverse projects. After that, I enrolled in the local
                integration course - Finnish language and cultures, completing the program with assessed levels of
                Listening B1.1, Speaking
                B1.2, Reading B1.1, and Writing B1.2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work and study, I’m someone who loves to explore the world. Traveling has become a part of my
                life—I plan trips almost every year, constantly expanding my personal world map and experiencing
                different cultures firsthand. These journeys have taught me adaptability, broadened my perspective, and
                strengthened my ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I’m expanding into AI and machine learning and applying what I learn by building real
                applications and experimenting with end-to-end projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey reflects who I am: someone who is not afraid to step out of their comfort zone, willing to
                try new things, and committed to continuous learning and personal growth—both professionally and
                personally.
